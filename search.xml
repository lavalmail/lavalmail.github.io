    <content type="text"><![CDATA[What exactly happens when a method is called? You may have noticed that x.f() was called without anargument above, even though the function definition for f() specified an argument. What happened to theargument? Surely Python raises an exception when a function that requires an argument is called withoutany — even if the argument isn’t actually used…Actually, you may have guessed the answer: the special thing about methods is that the instance object ispassed as the first argument of the function. In our example, the call x.f() is exactly equivalent to MyClass.f(x). In general, calling a method with a list of n arguments is equivalent to calling the correspondingfunction with an argument list that is created by inserting the method’s instance object before the firstargument.If you still don’t understand how methods work, a look at the implementation can perhaps clarify matters.When an instance attribute is referenced that isn’t a data attribute, its class is searched. If the namedenotes a valid class attribute that is a function object, a method object is created by packing (pointers to)the instance object and the function object just found together in an abstract object: this is the methodobject. When the method object is called with an argument list, a new argument list is constructed fromthe instance object and the argument list, and the function object is called with this new argument list.]]></content>
